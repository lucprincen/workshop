# Modern CSS Workshop

Install this copy of WordPress on a local environment. Import the database and change the urls in the options-table (record siteurl and homeurl) to your local environment. Also create a wp-config.php file and connect to the database. Please be aware that the $table_prefix is set to 'workshop'.

You can get into the WordPress admin with the incredibly horrible username / password combination admin/admin.
